Rate My PSU is a Google Chrome extension that puts RateMyProfessors ratings directly into LionPATH Class Search. It works by obtaining the names of each of the professors in Class Search, searching RateMyProfessors for the name, then returning and appending an html element next to the name in the original webpage.
